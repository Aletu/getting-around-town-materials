# Getting Around Town – Interactive Materials

This repository contains an educational prototype built with Svelte + Vite + Tailwind (DaisyUI). It currently includes two small interactive modules:

- Material #1 — Help the Visitor: short text hints where the learner selects the correct place (multiple choice).
- Material #2 — Safe Walk Sequence: short safety text plus an image ordering activity (drag & drop).

## For Development

1. Install dependencies

    ```powershell
    npm install
    ```

2. Start dev server (Vite will pick an available port)

    ```powershell
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Open the URL printed by Vite (for example: `http://localhost:5173`) and use the UI to try the modules.

Build & preview

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```
